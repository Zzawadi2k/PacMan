# PacMen
  My first Big In class Exercise, one that utilizes both javaScript and html. It's a bit simple, but at the same time it's very fun in so many ways since it's a recreation of one of the world's most beloved game. Pacman, a game that everyone knows! If you need to be reminded then you Gotta click the link provided on the top right side of this Repo to Truly experience the nostalgic feeling coming from their every chomp.   




## Developer Notes: 
Factory for making pacmen
You are given a starter.html code.
When button "make one" is pressed you need to complete the code 
to position the new pacman image and add it to the "game" div. It is then added to the array of pacmen, which keeps track of the position and velocity of each pacman.
You also need to make each pacman bounce off any wall it hits. 
Start by getting at least one pacman positioned and viewable.

The Chomping Portion of my 'starter.html' Code was Referced from A-Altemara, a classmate of mine.  
To Further understand the code, I'll quote an important message stated in their describtion...
 
      
" How to run:

Most recently Updated code so that the PacMen would reverse directions when the hit the left and right walls and would chomp as they do in the game.

Road Map: Correct Pacmen generating over the Start Game button Include virtical or diagonal facing Pacman for true directional represnetation "
